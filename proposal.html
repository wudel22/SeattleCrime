            <h2>Problem Description</h2>
            <br>
            <p>For our project, we decided to focus on the domain of crime rates in Seattle, especially the U-District
                area
                where we find a lot of college students living either alone or with other roommates. Our general
                topic/question for this project is: <mark class="highlight">What is the relationship between Seattle
                    locations and crime
                    rates?</mark> An
                information technology problem for crime rates in Seattle includes rare real-time alerts and
                authenticating
                crimes that alerts students about crimes that happened around campus areas. There are apps and websites
                that
                address crimes around people’s neighborhood, such as <a href="https://citizen.com/"
                    class="link-w">Citizen</a>, <a href="https://spotcrime.com/" class="link-w">Spotcrime</a>,
                and others. These
                apps/websites
                uses verified resources to input crime data into their apps, which allows citizens to be aware of
                incidents
                happening around their area. However, there isn’t a specific app that allows college students to know
                crimes
                happening live– especially at the University of Washington. Many students are alerted through their
                emails
                and text messages by UW alerts, but this is usually a few days after the crime has happened. We want to
                figure out how to make this system better, by providing students a safer way to alert crimes happening
                around campus.

    <!-- Section 2: Proposed application -->
    <section id="section-2" class="container">
        <h2>Proposed Application</h2>
        <br>
        <h3 id="section-2-1">Who are the users of the application?</h3>
        <p>The users are going to be mainly UW students and faculty, and residents in the Seattle area. Through this
            app, users will be able to see past and current crimes within the Seattle area and the time and location the
            crimes occurred. Minority groups who do not have access to the news or UW Alerts might not have access to
            the crimes that occur within the Seattle area. With this app that we create, they would be able to see and
            track which areas around Seattle are more dangerous so that they might plan routes and activities
            accordingly. UW students and faculty leave campus at some point during the day or their academic career at
            UW to explore and experience the Seattle area. Even with UW Alerts, the students and faculty would be in
            danger if they are already in the area of crime. Thus the importance of our app for students so they can
            <mark class="highlight">plan their travel times and routes accordingly. </mark>
        </p>
        <br>

        <h3 id="section-2-2">What will the users do with the web app?</h3>
        <p>
            The users will be able to utilize the interactive features so they can avoid streets that has high crime
            especially when they are walking alone or at night.
        <ul>
            <li>The user can view the <mark class="highlight">map</mark> by zooming in and zooming out
                of the map to specifically see the color-coded areas near where they are located.</li>
            <li>The developers will
                organize and visualize crime datasets to <mark class="highlight">color-code different areas</mark> in
                the city of Seattle to indicate
                which
                street or community has high or low crime rates. </li>
            <li>There will also be a <mark class="highlight">search feature</mark> to see
                specific communities within the city of Seattle which can be convenient for users who are planning to go
                to
                certain areas.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <br>

        <h3 id="section-2-3">What kind of information will the users be viewing?</h3>
        <p>
            The information users will be viewing will be the location and date of categorized crime information through
            a map. The crime information will be first grouped into the location of the community or street. Then
            depending on the number of crimes within 2008-present, it will be colored coded to indicate the number of
            crimes. The crimes will also be categorized within the location so the users can also look at how frequent
            is certain type of offense through the search feature. The <a
                href="https://data.seattle.gov/Public-Safety/SPD-Crime-Data-2008-Present/tazs-3rd5" class="link-w">SPD
                Crime Data:
                2008-Present | City of Seattle Open Data portal</a> website provides the csv files for crime information
            specifically in Seattle.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h3 id="section-2-4">How will using this app help to solve the problem?</h3>
        <p>
            There are many apps out there that allow citizens to be aware of crimes around them, and UW Alerts alerts
            people about crimes in Seattle in real-time. Yet, there isn’t an existing platform that allows users to see
            the details of past and current crimes that have occurred within a specific location. This is where our
            application comes in. Our application will provide the specific locations and times of crimes and will
            display them on a map to clearly show users exactly where they have occurred.
